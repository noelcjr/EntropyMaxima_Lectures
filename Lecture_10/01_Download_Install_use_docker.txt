TITLE: Instructions to run a Docker image in your computer's command prompt:

NOTE 1: In these tutorials, commands to be run from the operating system (OS) will
        be preceded by 'OS$', and commands to be run inside the docker container (DC)
        will be preceded by 'DC#'.

NOTE 2: Notice that for linux/ubunut users, we had to use sudo before every command outside
        the docker image, but once inside the docker image you do not need to use sudo anymore.
        This is because you have root access inside the docker container by default. If you
        are using Windows or a MAC, you might not need sudo, but you need to have roor access
        to run docker commands. Please check.

1. Download Docker from https://www.docker.com/
   and look for installation instructions for your operating system.
   There is plenty of online documentation, and it is a simple process.

2. After the program is installed you are going to pull the docker 
   image from a repository. The image is a copy of my Linux environment
   with all the programs you need to model proteins. Installing all of
   the programs is a long and difficult process and docker save us that
   trouble. the following command will download the image:

   OS$ sudo docker pull noelcjr/ccl_lectures:1.0

   NOTE: The sudo command is needed in Linux to have root authorization to
   run docker, and it prompts you for a password. Sudo might not work, or is
   not needed in macs or windows. Keep this in mind for every docker command.

3. When the imaged is downloaded, type the following command:

   OS$ sudo docker images		    

   you will see the image you just downloaded. That image is not running yet.

4. run an image inside a container like this:
		        
   OS$ sudo docker run -it noelcjr/ccl_lectures:1.0 bash
			       
   The above command will load the image and change the command prompt. You
   are now in a Linux/bash environment that is pre-configured with the programs 
   I use for the open insulin project. You might make, change or delete files, 
   but they will only remain available as long as the container is not deleted. 

5. An image container actually runs another operating system inside your operating
   system. Type 'exit' from within the container to return to your operating system's
   command line. 

   DC# exit

6. To check that a container is still present type:
			     
   OS$ sudo docker ps -a

   Copy the alphanumeric value on the left, under CONTAINER ID. You need this to
   get back into your image.

7. Access a container again without losing data inside it. 
   Your container could be active or not. If it is not active and you want to launch it
   DO NOT use the command in step 4 above. That will restart an image and you 
   will not see changes you made inside that container. Use the following two 
   commands to get back into an image from your operating system command prompt:
			            
   OS$ sudo docker start <CONTAINER ID>
   OS$ sudo docker attach <CONTAINER ID>

CONCLUSION: This simple process is how you download and image, launch a container
             with that image, exit the image, and access it again without losing the
data inside the container. This process is what we will use to run the tutorials for
each lecture.
