Title: Extracting structure's chains from within a CIF or PDB file

NOTE 1: In these tutorials, commands to be run from the operating system (OS) will
        be preceded by 'OS$', and commands to be run inside the docker container (DC# )
        will be preceded by 'DC# #'.

NOTE 2: Notice that for linux/ubunut users, we had to use sudo before every command outside
        the docker image, but once inside the docker image you do not need to use sudo anymore.
        This is because you have root access inside the docker container by default. If you
        are using Windows or a MAC, you might not need sudo, but you need to have roor access
        to run docker commands. Please check.

   We downloaded 1BRS.pdb and 1BRS.cif in the previous tutorial.
   1BRS has 6 chains, A,B,C,D,E and F. AD, BE and CF form dimers.
   It is a crystal structure with three dimers, and we only need one.
   How do I know that the crystal structure has three dimers of the same
   protein instead of one complex formed by three pairs of proteins? The
   simplest way to find out is by reading the crystalographic paper that
   is in bith the PDB and CIF headers with meta data information.
   
   Chains belonging to the same dimers are not contiguous to each other
   in alphatical order by identifiers in this crystal structure, but it is
   a common practice in other crystal structures. You would expect to have A and B
   chains forming a dimer, as well as CD and EF, but for unknown reasons
   the crystalographers chose to label chains differently. This could
   only be observed after opening the structure on VMD outside the docker
   container. From this observation, we write the first command. 

1. Go inside the container image where the PDB and CIF files were downloaded.

   OS$ sudo docker ps -a
 
   Copy the CONTAINER ID on the top left.

   OS$ sudo docker start <CONTAINER ID>
   OS$ sudo docker attach <CONTAINER ID>

   You might have to hit enter a couple times for the container to load.

2. Once inside the container, change directory to Lecture_1 in CCL_Lectures where
   the CIF and PDB files that you downloaded in the previous tutorial are found:

   DC# cd /home/CCL_Lectures/Lecture_1/

2. Extract chains corresponding to dimers in the PDB file. For most protein
   modeling exercises, we only need one dimer that we need to extract, or separate,
   from the other two dimers. The following command separates chains from structures
   by AD,BE,CF and generates outputs in PDB format.

   DC# pdb_cif.py extract --input 1BRS.cif --chains --groups AD,BE,CF

   As always, confirm that what you did this right by copying the generated PDB 
   files from within the container to your computers operating system and open it 
   with VMD, and after that return to the container. We have three new PDB files 
   with different chains, and we now need to pick one for more analysis.

2. It is difficult to detect all the gaps in structure by visual inspection.
   Gaps in the middle of the sequence are easy to miss, and gaps at the
   begining or end of each chain of the proteins are even harder to detect visually.
   The following command does a gap analysis that gives the parts of the protein
   that are present in the sequence, but for which there is no coordinates in the 
   crystal structure.

   DC# pdb_cif.py gaps --input 1BRS_0_AD.pdb
   DC# pdb_cif.py gaps --input 1BRS_0_BE.pdb
   DC# pdb_cif.py gaps --input 1BRS_0_CF.pdb

   The output gave a Model number and a Chain identifier. SOme PDBs have more than
   one structure of the same protein, and they are usally number starting at 0.
 
   The three numbers inside the parenthesis correpond to the gap number and the
   amino acid number ranges. For example: (1,2,6) is read as gap 1 that corresponds
   to missing amino acids 2,3,4,5,6. When there are no gaps, the output is (0,0,0).

3. It is now possible to complete missing regions in some dimers, from regions
   present in other dimers. Completing resideus 1 and 2 missing in chain C from 
   chain B using the following command.

   pdb_cif.py align --ref 1BRS_0_BE.pdb --refatoms CA,B,3,6 --fit 1BRS_0_CF.pdb --fitatoms CA,C,3,6 --out 1BRS_complete_CD_1.pdb --addatoms B,1,2:C,1,2

4. Copy 1BRS_0_BE.pdb, 1BRS_0_CF.pdb and 1BRS_complete_CD_1.pdb to your operating system 
   and open them with VMD to check that atoms were added from one structure to
   the other after aligning the structures.

CONCLUSION: It is important to know what is inside a PDB or CIF structure file to
            know if there are mutiple repeated structures of the same protein. We then can
extract only one dimer from the original crystal structure and use the other dimers
`to fill gaps in the selected dimer.
