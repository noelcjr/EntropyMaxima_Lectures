TITLE: Instructions to download and visualize a structure file while working within a docker image.

NOTE 1: In these tutorials, commands to be run from the operating system (OS) will
        be preceded by 'OS$', and commands to be run inside the docker container (DC)
        will be preceded by 'DC#'.

NOTE 2: Notice that for linux/ubunut users, we had to use sudo before every command outside
        the docker image, but once inside the docker image you do not need to use sudo anymore.
        This is because you have root access inside the docker container by default. If you
        are using Windows or a MAC, you might not need sudo, but you need to have roor access
        to run docker commands. Please check.

We will download a PDB and CIF file from within a docker image container, and then copy the 
PDB file outside the docker container to see the structure in your computer with VMD. 
The docker container runs in a Linux/command-prompt environment and VMD uses a graphical
user interface, so we need to export the PDB file from within the docker container to our 
computer's file system to open it.

1. Launch a new container:

   OS$ sudo docker run -it noelcjr/ccl_lectures:1.0 bash

2. Install wget from inside the container. Until the docker image is updated,
   we will install this program manually every time we launch a NEW image's docker container.

   DC# apt-get install wget

3. We are going to work on tutorials and Code that is constantly imporved and
   updated, so we need to pull any new information from the two repositories that we use:

   DC# cd home/CCL_Lectures/
   DC# ls -lt

   The previous command lists the files inside the CCL_Lectures folder.

   DC# git pull
   DC# ls -lt

   Listing the files after a git pull will show that a few more directories where 
   downloaded from the lecture's repositorie. We will now do the same for the
   Entropy Maxima Python code that we use.
 
   DC# cd ../Programs/EntropyMaxima/
   DC# git pull

4. After updating the EntropyMaxime repository in the last step, we now need to
   install the EntropyMaxima software again. From inside ENtropyMaxima folder type:

   DC# python setup.py install

5. Change directory to the Lecture_1 in CCL_Lectures folder.

   DC# cd ../../CCL_Lectures/Lecture_1/ 

3. Download both 1BRS.pdb and 1BRS.cif. The path to any structure can be found on
   www.rcsb.org. The files will download to your Lecture_1 directory.

   DC# wget https://files.rcsb.org/view/1BRS.pdb
   DC# wget https://files.rcsb.org/view/1BRS.cif

4. Exit your container and return to your operating system command prompt.

   DC# exit

5. You can access files in your docker image container even if the container is not
   running, or you can access this files while the container is runnning and from
   another terminal or window (Preferred for these tutorials). In either case, to copy
   a PDB file from within a container to your computer, you need to get the CONTAINER ID 
   where the file was downloaded. Run the following command from the command line of your 
   operating system:

   OS$ sudo docker ps -a

   The Container ID is on the left, under 'CONTAINER ID', if there are more than one,
   pick the top one, or most recent one. We will use this ID in the next step. 

6. Run this in you OS's command prompt to copy the pdb file. Substitute CONTAINERID
   with the actual container id obtained in the previous step:

   OS$ sudo docker cp CONTAINERID:/home/CCL_Lectures/Lecture_1/1BRS.pdb ./1BRS.pdb

7. You can now open the crystal structure in your computer with VMD. The pdf file inside
   the 'Presentation' folder in this lecture have some of the most important tools you
   need when using VMD. There are also many tutorials on line with instructions on
   how to visualize crystal structures using VMD. I recommend the following
   tutorial: http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/vmd/vmd-tutorial.pdf

8. Open the PDB file that we just downloaded in VMD, and notice that there are three
   dimers of the same protein. Which one is the right one? We will pick one in the
   next tutorial. Also, the three dimers are formed by two chains. What are the labels
   of the chains for each dimer?

CONCLUSION: In this tutorial you downloaded an structure file inside a container and
            copied the file to your operating system for visualisation. This is
very important when we using other tools to modify the structure and we want to visually
confirm the changes.
